# AWS Security Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on journey in **AWS Security**, starting with the **AWS Security Reference Architecture (SRA)** and expanding into projects that demonstrate real-world security practices.  
The goal is to showcase practical skills, not just theory. Each folder contains explanations, screenshots, and eventually automation code that map to AWS security best practices.
